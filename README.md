# Data Graphing Tool

_In development!_

The Data Graphing Tool is a web application that providers users with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to perform a typical Machine Learning (ML) task. Once the user uploads a CSV file of data into the app, they are taken through a standard ML process, highlighted in figure 1. The app is designed for users with no prior programming knowledge but understand ML concepts or do not have time to write an algorithm and need an efficient way to visualise and understand their data.
